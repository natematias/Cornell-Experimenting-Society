        <b>Update, April 2020: I have added two additional sections to
          this document:<br>
        </b>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#Values_For_Resilience_Spring_2020">Values for
              Resilience, Spring 2020</a></li>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Weekly Workload</h2>
        <p>Before each class, I will assign two readingsâ€“&nbsp;usually
          one newspaper article and one academic article that I expect
          you to read <strong><em>before</em></strong> class. As part
          of class participation, you will submit a reaction comment on
          one of the readings to Slack and respond to at least one other
          student's comment by <strong>9pm Eastern the night before
            class</strong>.</p>
        <p>Assignments in the class unfold in three parts which each
          have a distinct workload. In the first part of the class
          (Jan-Feb), you will do individual or pair assignment each
          week. This will sometimes involve writing, sometimes analysis,
          and sometimes both. In the second part (March), you will form
          teams of 3-4 students and develop a project proposal. In the
          final part (April), you will work with your team to complete
          the final project. For special topics (like bandit
          algorithms), I may assign you to work in your pairs again.</p>
        <p>Weekly assignments are due on <strong>Tuesdays at 9pm</strong>
          <b>Eastern </b>unless otherwise noted.</p>
        <p>In <strong>lectures/discussions</strong>, we will discuss a
          topic within experimentation and the ethics/governance of
          behavioral research. <br>
        </p>
        <p>In <strong>workshops</strong>, we will focus more on
          technical topics, statistical methods, and discussions about
          your final projects.</p>
        <p>I will occasionally offer short quizzes to gauge inform how
          quickly we go through technical topics in workshop sessions.</p>
        <h2>Final Project</h2>
        <p>This class has a two-part final:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A group project, due on <strong>May 18 by 9pm</strong></li>
          <li>A final personal essay, due on <strong>May 18 by 9pm</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The final project will either be an analysis of data from the
          Upworthy Archive or a new design for a field experiment that
          you have developed with a community partner (such as The Lab
          of Ornithology).</p>
        <p>In the final personal essay (1200-1500 words), you will pick
          one of the questions about ethics and governance of behavioral
          research that we have discussed in class and write about your
          group project from that perspective. The essay should be your
          own work and should include a list of references.</p>
        <p>The <strong>midterm</strong> for this class is group project
          proposal and a proposal for your personal essay.</p>
        <h2>Participation in Discussions and Workshops<br>
        </h2>
        Please post discussions about readings and questions about the
        course to our chatroom on slack, <a
          href="https://comm4940.slack.com/">comm4940.slack.com</a>.
        Please use your Cornell University email address when requesting
        to join the workspace.<br>
        <br>
        <p><b>Whenever the course has assigned reading for a session,
            you are expected to post at least one top-level comment and
            one reply to Slack.</b> Participation will be 20% of your
          course grade.</p>
        <p>Here is how we will use channels:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>#readings</b>: please post your comment and your reply
            to this channel. This space will be evaluated for your
            participation grade.<br>
          </li>
          <li><b>#class-sessions</b>: this room is for live
            discussion/lectures and for discussions related to workshop
            sessions. Please use threads as much as possible to make it
            easier for fellow students to navigate</li>
          <li><b>#cocalc</b>: this room is for discussion of cocalc
            issues</li>
          <li><b>#class-logistics</b>: is for discussion of class and
            syllabus issues, as well as general technical challenges</li>
          <li><b>#random</b>: is for news links to relevant content
            you're finding online and general encouragement to your
            fellow students</li>
          <li><b>team-specific rooms</b> are for coordinating with your
            team and sharing project-specific questions to the professor<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>Since there will be a few times that we're doing analyses
          that exceed some laptops, we're using the <a
            href="https://cocalc.com">CoCalc</a> system, which is a bit
          like Google Docs for data analysis. I'll introduce the system
          in class for our first assignment, on Wednesday, Jan 29 and
          make sure everyone has an account. Parts of the class
          involving CoCalc will be supported by <a
            href="https://notconfusing.com/">Max Klein</a>, a data
          engineer who works for the CivilServant project, a nonprofit
          that I'm mergint to Cornell to become the Citizens and
          Technology Lab. Max will be available over Slack if you have
          issues with the CoCalc system.</p>
        <h2>Team Progress Reports</h2>
        <p>During the project period of the class, teams will submit on
          Canvas a weekly progress report no more than one page long, as
          group homework. This progress report will be graded. Reports
          should include the following details (<a
href="https://github.com/natematias/class-team-templates/blob/master/weekly-update-example.md">a
            sample template is available here</a>):</p>
        <ul>
          <li> What your team made progress on </li>
          <li> What your team is doing next </li>
          <li> Who contributed what </li>
          <li> Where your team is stuck </li>
          <li> Any updates to your timeline </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Group Work and Academic Integrity</h2>
        <p>I expect students to follow the <a
            href="http://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/academic-integrity/">Cornell

            University Code of Academic Integrity</a>. You should submit
          your work as your own, cite sources and outside assistance,
          and credit people for their contributions.</p>
        <p>This class includes group work and individual assignments. On
          group projects, you are encouraged to work together on the
          activities for the class, but you are only only able to put
          your name on projects to which you made an intellectual
          contribution. If you have any doubts about what is
          appropriate, ask me.</p>
        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>I use the following grading scale, <a
            href="http://www.princeton.edu/%7Emjs3/scale.shtml">derived
            from Matt Salganik's grading practices</a>.</p>
        <p>All grades are final. There will not be any make-up or extra
          credit assignments offered.</p>
        <p>Per university procedures, I will only give a grade of A+ in
          exceptional circumstances. </p>

        <h2>Grace Period</h2>
        Late Submissions: All assignments have an automatic one-day
        grace period. On time and early papers are always encouraged and
        will be graded the same week. Students can turn in the
        assignment up to a day late, no questions asked, with the
        expectation that it could take substantially longer to receive a
        grade and feedback. After that, an automatic one grade (A to B,
        B to C, etc) is dropped on the assignment. </div>
      <h2>Accommodations</h2>
      <p>Please let me know as soon as possible if you need
        accommodations (e.g. for disabilities). </p>
      <h2>Counseling Resources</h2>
      <p>It is common for students to experience stressful events at
        some point during graduate school. Students sometimes experience
        depression, anxiety, family stress, the loss of loved ones,
        financial strain, and other stressors. It is perfectly normal
        for students to seek the service of mental health professionals
        to provide them with support and skills to cope with these
        experiences. Below I have provided the contact information for
        some of the mental health services available to Cornell
        University students so that you will know where you can go if
        you or a friend would like to take advantage of these resources.</p>

      soon as possible.
      <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
      <p>Several sections of these policies have been inspired by
        syllabi from Matthew Salganik, Adrienne Keene, and Neil Lewis
        Jr.<br>
      </p>
      <h2><a name="Values_For_Resilience_Spring_2020"></a>Values For
        Resilience, Spring 2020</h2>
      While plans can be disrupted, <b>values</b> are helpful tools to
      guide decision-making when things go wrong at unpredictable times.
      So as we resume classes, I want you to know what my values will
      be.<br>
      <br>
      First, I will prioritize the <b>class learning goals</b> (<a
        href="index.html">see the syllabus index</a>). I am confident
      that by the end of the semester, each of you will still be able to
      understand, design, analyze, and critique field experiments and
      their role in society.<br>
      <br>
      Above all I want to be <b>available</b> to students in a
      supportive and timely way.<br>
      <br>
      I will prioritize <b>consistency</b> in how we interact, try to
      minimize sources of unpredictability, and communicate changes well
      in advance and on the syllabus.<br>
      <br>
      I will prioritize <b>accessibility</b> in class materials,
      assignments, and how I facilitate discussion. I will organize
      class as much as possible to support everyone equally,
      accommodating a range of locations and logistical needs. I will
      also build&nbsp;
      <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <b>redundancy</b> into class processes.<br>
      <br>
      In assessment, I will continue to prioritize <b>participation,
        mutual support, and growth</b>. My assessment goal is to provide
      the feedback you need to grow; not to add stress by measuring you
      up on an imaginary pre-pandemic scale. Since each studentâ€™s
      learning depends on discussion and collaboration with others, I
      will continue to assess asynchronous participation.<br>
      <h2><a name="FAQ_April_2020"></a>FAQ April 2020</h2>
      <h4><b>How Will Class Sessions Work?</b></h4>
      <p>I have updated the <a
          href="file:///Users/nathan/Documents/github/comm4940/syllabus.html">top

          of the syllabus</a> to include full details of class formats.
        Based on how things go in the first two weeks, I may update the
        syllabus one final time by <b>Friday April 17</b>. The section
        in this page on using Slack has a list of how to use the
        channels.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4><b>My Time Zone Is Far From EDT. How Can I Participate?</b></h4>
      The weekly schedule has been adjusted to include discussion time
      for students in Asia and Europe. See <a href="syllabus.html">the
        syllabus</a> for details.<br>
      <b></b><br>
      <h4><b>Can We Still Do Our Project?</b></h4>
      The new deadline for project proposals is <b>Tuesday, April 14</b>.
      Projects involving designing field experiments are likely
      impossible now. I strongly encourage teams to shift (if you
      haven't already) to <a
href="https://github.com/natematias/design-governance-experiments/tree/master/assignments/upworthy-archive-project">the

        default Upworthy Archive project</a>. but if you think you can
      finish your original project idea, contact me ASAP. <br>
      <b><br>
      </b>
      <h4><b>What Happens To Our Team?</b></h4>
      <p>Since there is minimal time remaining in the semester, teams
        should stick with the group they have already chosen. <b>I may
          permit a small number of swaps for time zone issues if you
          contact me by April 8th</b>. Any later, and it would be unfair
        to team members.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4><b>How Can We Collaborate Remotely?</b></h4>
      <p><b>Coordination:</b> I have created an online chat room for
        each team and encourage you to coordinate there.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Documents &amp; Files: </b>Cornell has advised that
        firewall issues may prevent students from accessing Google Docs
        or in some cases even email. To aid in collaboration, I have
        created CoCalc projects for each team. I strongly encourage you
        to use your CoCalc project for team collaboration since it is
        widely accessible and I can access when grading. I have created
        a repository of <a
          href="https://github.com/natematias/class-team-templates">template

          documents for team collaboration on CoCalc</a> and have added
        it to each project.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Documents in CoCalc are written using Markdown, which creates
        formatted documents from a few simple text codes. You can <a
          href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">learn more
          about Markdown here</a>.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4><b>We Prefer To Use Google Docs/Drive<br>
        </b></h4>
      <b>If you want to use Google Docs/Drive, you must first confirm
        that every team member will have consistent access to the
        service throughout the semester.</b> If I have confirmation in
      chat from every team member, I will create a folder for the team.
      That will prevent situations where the professor doesn't have read
      access to documents he is supposed to grade.<br>

    <div class="container">
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <h4><b>How Will We Get Updates?</b></h4>
      <p>I will post all class-wide updates to students via Canvas,
        alongside a thread in Slack.</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <h4><b>Contingency Plans</b></h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>If you have technical problems</b>, please communicate
          with the professor via slack or email ASAP so he can make
          accommodations<br>
        </li>
        <li><b>If the professor is incapacitated</b>, the class will be
          continued by Professor <a href="https://neillewisjr.com/">Neil

            Lewis Jr.</a> and Max Klein.</li>
        <li><b>If you are incapacitated</b> and unable to continue the
          class, please:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact the professor, who will likely encourage you to
            take an incomplete<br>
