        <h1>COMM 4242: Course Policies and Logistics<br>
        </h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Weekly Workload</h2>
        <p>Before each class, I will assign two readingsâ€“&nbsp;usually
          one newspaper article and one academic article that I expect
          you to read <strong><em>before</em></strong> class. As part
          of class participation, you will submit a reaction comment on
          one of the readings to Slack and respond to at least one other
          student's comment by <strong>9pm Eastern the night before
            class</strong>.</p>
        <p>Assignments in the class unfold in three parts which each
          have a distinct workload. In the first part of the class
          (Jan-Feb), you will do individual or pair assignment each
          week. This will sometimes involve writing, sometimes analysis,
          and sometimes both. In the second part (March), you will form
          teams of 3-4 students and develop a project proposal. In the
          final part (April), you will work with your team to complete
          the final project. For special topics (like bandit
          algorithms), I may assign you to work in your pairs again.</p>
        <p>Weekly assignments are due on <strong>Tuesdays at 9pm</strong>
          <b>Eastern </b>unless otherwise noted.</p>
        <p>In <strong>lectures/discussions</strong>, we will discuss a
          topic within experimentation and the ethics/governance of
          behavioral research. <br>
        </p>
        <p>In <strong>workshops</strong>, we will focus more on
          technical topics, statistical methods, and discussions about
          your final projects.</p>
        <p>I will occasionally offer short quizzes to gauge inform how
          quickly we go through technical topics in workshop sessions.</p>
        <h2>Final Project</h2>
        <p>This class has a two-part final:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A group project, due on <strong>DATE by 9pm</strong></li>
          <li>A final personal essay, due on <strong>DATE by 9pm</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The final project will either be an analysis of data from the
          Upworthy Archive or a new design for a field experiment that
          you have developed with a community partner (such as The Lab
          of Ornithology).</p>
        <p>In the final personal essay (1200-1500 words), you will pick
          one of the questions about ethics and governance of behavioral
          research that we have discussed in class and write about your
          group project from that perspective. The essay should be your
          own work and should include a list of references.</p>
        <p>The <strong>midterm</strong> for this class is group project
          proposal and a proposal for your personal essay.</p>
        <h2>Participation in Discussions and Workshops<br>
        </h2>
        Please post discussions about readings and questions about the
        course to our chatroom at <b>LOCATION</b>. Please use your
        Cornell University email address when requesting to join the
        workspace.<br>
        <br>
        <p><b>Whenever the course has assigned reading for a session,
            you are expected to post at least one top-level comment and
            one reply to the chat.</b> Participation will be 20% of your
          course grade.</p>
        <p>Here is how we will use channels:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>#readings</b>: please post your comment and your reply
            to this channel. This space will be evaluated for your
            participation grade.<br>
          </li>
          <li><b>#class-sessions</b>: this room is for live
            discussion/lectures and for discussions related to workshop
            sessions. Please use threads as much as possible to make it
            easier for fellow students to navigate</li>
          <li><b>#cocalc</b>: this room is for discussion of cocalc
            issues</li>
          <li><b>#class-logistics</b>: is for discussion of class and
            syllabus issues, as well as general technical challenges</li>
          <li><b>#random</b>: is for news links to relevant content
            you're finding online and general encouragement to your
            fellow students</li>
          <li><b>team-specific rooms</b> are for coordinating with your
            team and sharing project-specific questions to the professor<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>Since there will be a few times that we're doing analyses
          that exceed some laptops, we're using the <a
            href="https://cocalc.com">CoCalc</a> system, which is a bit
          like Google Docs for data analysis. I'll introduce the system
          in class for our first assignment, on Wednesday, Jan 29 and
          make sure everyone has an account. <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Team Progress Reports</h2>
        <p>During the project period of the class, teams will submit on
          Canvas a weekly progress report no more than one page long, as
          group homework. This progress report will be graded. Reports
          should include the following details (<a
href="https://github.com/natematias/class-team-templates/blob/master/weekly-update-example.md">a
            sample template is available here</a>):</p>
        <ul>
          <li> What your team made progress on </li>
          <li> What your team is doing next </li>
          <li> Who contributed what </li>
          <li> Where your team is stuck </li>
          <li> Any updates to your timeline </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Group Work and Academic Integrity</h2>
        <p>I expect students to follow the <a
            href="http://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/academic-integrity/">Cornell




            University Code of Academic Integrity</a>. You should submit
          your work as your own, cite sources and outside assistance,
          and credit people for their contributions.</p>
        <p>This class includes group work and individual assignments. On
          group projects, you are encouraged to work together on the
          activities for the class, but you are only only able to put
          your name on projects to which you made an intellectual
          contribution. If you have any doubts about what is
          appropriate, ask me.</p>
        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>I use the following grading scale, <a
            href="http://www.princeton.edu/%7Emjs3/scale.shtml">derived
            from Matt Salganik's grading practices</a>.</p>
        <p>All grades are final. There will not be any make-up or extra
          credit assignments offered.</p>
        <p>Per university procedures, I will only give a grade of A+ in
          exceptional circumstances. </p>

        <h2>Grace Period</h2>
        Late Submissions: All assignments have an automatic one-day
        grace period. On time and early papers are always encouraged and
        will be graded the same week. Students can turn in the
        assignment up to a day late, no questions asked, with the
        expectation that it could take substantially longer to receive a
        grade and feedback. After that, an automatic one grade (A to B,
        B to C, etc) is dropped on the assignment. </div>
      <h2>Accommodations</h2>
      <p>Please let me know as soon as possible if you need
        accommodations (e.g. for disabilities). </p>
      <h2>Counseling Resources</h2>
      <p>It is common for students to experience stressful events at
        some point during graduate school. Students sometimes experience
        depression, anxiety, family stress, the loss of loved ones,
        financial strain, and other stressors. It is perfectly normal
        for students to seek the service of mental health professionals
        to provide them with support and skills to cope with these
        experiences. Below I have provided the contact information for
        some of the mental health services available to Cornell
        University students so that you will know where you can go if
        you or a friend would like to take advantage of these resources.</p>
      <p><a href="https://health.cornell.edu/">Cornell Health</a>: 110
        Ho Plaza, Ithaca NY. Phone: 607-255-5155.</p>
      If you require a short term accommodation, please let me know as
      soon as possible.
