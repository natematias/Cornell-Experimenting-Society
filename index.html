        <p>Online platforms, which monitor and intervene in the lives of
          billions of people, routinely host thousands of experiments.
          These studies evaluate policies, test products, and contribute
          to theory in the social sciences. They are also powerful tools
          to monitor injustice and govern human and algorithm behavior.

        <p>In this hands-on class, students will develop practical
          experimentation skills, engaging with methods, theory, ethics,
          and governance of large-scale behavioral research online. For
          a final project, student teams design or analyze results from
          a novel experiment in online behavior. </p>
        <strong>By the end of the semester, you will be able to</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Identify, analyze, and evaluate the quantitative content
            of field experiments in the social sciences and computer
            science<br>
          </li>
          <li>Describe and evaluate the kinds of knowledge that
            experiments bring to policy, product design, and theories in
            the social sciences, as well as their limitations<br>
          </li>
          <li>Summarize and criticize leading views on the ethics and
            governance of experiments in society, and in relation to
            your own project</li>
          <li>Design and analyze research from the perspective of rapid
            experimentation and reproduction in industry and the social
            sciences<br>
          </li>
          <li>Understand the kinds of knowledge that experiments bring

        <h2>Activities</h2>
        <p><b>Weekly Activities:</b> Throughout the semester, students
          will read a selection of articles and discuss that reading in
          class and in an online chat. In the first half of the
          semester, students will complete a weekly assignment in pairs.
          In the second half of the semester, once teams have been
          formed, students will submit regular progress reports on their
          team project.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Midterm: </b>The midterm is a group proposal for your team
          project, including a description of the project, a list of the
          roles that team members will play, and a timeline.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Final Project:</b> The final for the class is two-part. The
          first part is a group project and final group presentation of
          that project (in small teams). The second part of the final is
          a 900 word argumentative essay that analyzes one aspect of
          your group project through the lens of one of the critical
          issues introduced in the class.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Grading:</b> Participation in class &amp; online: 20%.
          Weekly assignments: 20%. Midterm project proposal: 20%. Final
          project: 40%.</p>

        <p>Many users join gender-related discussions online to discuss
          current events and their personal experiences. However, people
          sometimes feel unwelcome those communities for two reasons.
          First of all, they may be interested in participating in
          constructive discussions, but their opinions differ from the a
          community's vocal majority. Accordingly, they feel
          uncomfortable voicing these opinions due to fear of an
          overwhelmingly negative reaction. Furthermore, as we
          discovered in a survey, some participants in online gender
          conversations oppose feminism and wish to make the experience
          uncomfortable for commenters.</p>
        <p>In this ongoing study, two undergraduate students worked with
          moderators of an online community to test the effects on
          newcomer participation of interventions that provide
          first-time participants with more accurate information about
          the values of the community and its organizers.<br>

        <img src="website-assets/disinformation-slide.png" align="right"

        <p>In information security, warning messages are used to inform
          users of potential threats, including malware distribution,
          phishing, and spam. This team (Ben Kaiser, Kevin Lee, Elena
          Lucherini, and Frishta Abdul Wali) set out to study if warning
          messages could influence users to disengage with
          disinformation websites.</p>
        <p>Because the possible message designs too numerous to be
          tested using randomized trials, this team created a <a

        <p>In this study, we asked how common these mistakes are and
          what kinds of ads are mistakenly prohibited by Facebook and
          Google. Over 23 days, 7 U.S. citizens living inside and
          outside the United States attempted to publish 477
          non-election advertisements that varied in the type of ad, its
          potentially-mistaken political leaning, and its geographic
          targeting to a federal or state election voter population.
          Google did not prohibit any of the ads posted. Facebook
          prohibited 4.2% of the submitted ads.</p>
