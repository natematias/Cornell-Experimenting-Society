The midterm on March 24th will be a two-part midterm ([details here](https://github.com/natematias/design-governance-experiments/tree/master/assignments/midterm-project-proposal)). The first part will involve a team project proposal (teams of four). The second part will be a proposal for the **personal essay** in the course. You will have a chance to submit a draft essay proposal later.

For the project proposal assignment, **due March 10th at 9pm**, you need to:
* Find an initial team of 4 people
* Identify a question you would like to study (knowing that it might have to change substantially over the next few weeks)
* Complete as much of the project proposal outline as you can, in a Google Doc. Your goal is to get as far as you can toward agreement, while also being open about your questions and uncertainties
* Submit a Word Doc or PDF in Canvas with a link to the Google Doc for your project proposal
* Professor Matias will offer feedback directly on the Google Doc
