## Overview

### Part One: Project Proposal
The first part of the midterm is a project proposal that will be submitted by the group. This will be half of your midterm grade.

The purpose of your project proposal is to provide your team a chance to formalize how you plan to approach the project you take on, to describe the major parts of the project, and to craft an initial timeline. A draft **Google Doc** of the proposal is due by **March 10 at 9pm** and the full proposal will be due by **March 24th at 9pm** .

I will send each team an empty Google Doc over slack.

### Part Two: Final Essay Proposal
The second part of the midterm is a *personal* three-paragraph proposal due **March 24th at 9pm** for the essay that you will individually write as part of your final. The final essay will be a 1200 - 1500 word essay that unpacks or makes an argument about one of the topics we have explored in class, in relation to the experiment that you developed with your team. You can pick anything from the syllabus as a starting point (or discuss others with me). For example, possible topics include:
* Experimentation systems
* Audits & Accountability
* Research Transparency & Privacy
* Replication
* Clickbait
* Manipulation
* Ethics oversight
* Scientific Explanation & Description
* Advancing Science and Pragmatic Knowledge together
* ...etc...

In this three-paragraph proposal, you will:
* Introduce the topic
* Explain how it relates to your team project
* Say more about the kind of essay you think you will write (Will you argue for a particular choice? Will you critique a decision in the project? Will you propose a new way of seeing that issue? etc...)
* Include a bibliography with 3-5 references that you are going to start with

## Project Proposal Outline
Your project proposal should include the following details. Remember that the final is submitted in early May.

### Proposal Outline (if you're using the Upworthy Archive)
* Title
* The names of everyone on your team
* Description of the question you want to ask in the dataset (3 paragraphs)
  * Description of the question you want to explore in the dataset
  * Explanation for why you think it would be possible to ask this question of the Upworthy archive
  * Description of who you think would be interested in this knowledge (what kind of scientists or practitioners?)
* Early research implementation ideas:
  * How are you going to identify the kind of A/B tests you're looking for?
  * What skills you would need to bring to bear
* Outline of team roles, with a one sentence description of each role. Here are some examples (though for some of these, you might want everyone to be involved):
  * Coordination and communication
  * Internal team project management & coordination
  * Literature review & Hypothesis development
  * Analysis & software development 
* Proposed Timeline (possible entries include)
  * Setting up infrastructure
    * Zotero for references management
    * Task & project management (Trello may help here)
    * Code versioning and sharing (Github may work- if you need a private repo, just ask)
    * Data sharing (CoCalc will be helpful here)
  * Complete an initial literature review
  * Develop hypotheses and test them on the exploratory dataset
  * Develop software to identify the patterns you're interested in the data
  * Produce an analysis plan
  * Collectively write a short paper about your hypothesis and your method
  * Run the analysis on the confirmatory dataset
  * Update the paper to include the full analysis (this is what you submit for the final)
* List of risks and unanswered questions that Professor Matias can help answer
* References 

### Proposal Outline (if you're planning to design a new study)
* Title
* The names of everyone on your team
* Description of the project (3 paragraphs)
  * Description of the pragmatic purpose of the experiment
  * Description of the stakeholders in the project (who is the partner, who will the participants be?)
  * Description of some possible scientific questions relevant to the project
* Early experiment design thoughts
  * Draft description of the intervention (several sentences)
  * Draft description of the kinds of things you might measure (several sentences or bullet points)
* Description of any ethics questions you anticipate (paragraph, but can start out as bullet points)
* Outline of team roles, with a one sentence description of each role (for example):
  * Coordination and communication with partners
  * Internal team project management & coordination
  * Analysis
  * Literature review
  * IRB (coordinated with Professor Matias)
  * Software development (if needed)
* Proposed Timeline (possible entries include)
  * Setting up infrastructure
    * Zotero for references management
    * Task & project management (Trello may help here)
    * Code versioning and sharing (Github may work- if you need a private repo, just ask)
    * Data sharing (CoCalc will be helpful here)
  * Meet with partners
  * Complete an initial literature review
  * Produce an experiment design document
  * Confirm the experiment design with the partner
  * Complete an experiment plan  (the thing you submit for the final)
  * Prototype and test any required software
  * ...
* List of risks and unanswered questions that Professor Matias can help answer
