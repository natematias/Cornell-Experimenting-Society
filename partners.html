        <h1>Partnering with COMM 4242: The Design &amp; Governance of
          Digital Experiments<br>
        </h1>
        <br>
        Is your community or organization interested to collect
        systematic, causal evidence on an issue that matters to you? Are
        you interested to learn more about digital experiments, grapple
        with questions about the power that entails, and support new
        generations of digital experimenters? If so, consider
        collaborating with COMM 4242 on research together! This course
        supports juniors and seniors at Cornell to develop experiments
        in teams while also thinking and writing about how society can
        govern and steer the power of behavioral research.<br>
        <br>
        Past collaborators have included the Cornell Lab of Ornithology,
        WikiLovesAfrica, and online communities including
        r/feminism,&nbsp; r/futurology, and r/iama on reddit. We have
        posted example projects below.<br>
        <h2>What is a field experiment?</h2>
        <p>This course focuses on field experiments, research that tests
          the effect of some hypothesis out in the world. All
          experiments have at least the following:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A clear <b>goal</b></li>
          <li>A <b>theory of change</b> that explains the factors that
            are important to that goal</li>
          <li><b>Participants</b> - a group of people, situations, or
            institutions that are important for that goal<br>
          </li>
          <li>An <b>intervention</b> that can be delivered to (or by)
            the participants to achieve that goal, informed by the
            theory of change. Interventions can include audit studies.<br>
          </li>
          <li><b>Measures</b> that can be used to detect the outcomes of
            the interventions with the participants, especially if they
            are observations of behavior<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Projects that aren't an experiment include:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Observational research</b>: if the data isn't a
            randomized trial, it won't work for this class.</li>
          <li><b>Surveys</b>: while it's valuable to study people's
            beliefs and attitudes, they are not the focus of this class<br>
          </li>
          <li><b>Anything where an intervention can't be randomly
              assigned</b>: if we can't use random assignment, it's not
            an experiment<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What makes a good collaboration partnership?</h2>
        <p>Since this course supports students to develop research ideas
          within about 3 months, successful collaborations tend to have
          the following characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The partner group has a <b>clear goal, and sense of
              possible interventions</b>. Example: the Cornell Lab of
            Ornithology knew it wanted to increase participation in
            citizen science. <br>
          </li>
          <li>The partner group <b>already has access to thousands or
              tens of thousands of participants</b>. Example: The Lab of
            Ornithology knew they would have a mailing list with nearly
            ten thousand people.<br>
          </li>
          <li>The partner group <b>already has the capacity to measure
              the outcomes that matter</b>. Example: The Lab of
            Ornithology already had systems to track how people
            contribute to Citizen Science, even if they had not
            previously used that data for experiments.<br>
          </li>
          <li>The partner group <b>has resources and staff to support
              in multiple meetings throughout the semester </b>to
            support the design and implementation of a study. Example: A
            staff member at the Lab of Ornithology was able to liaise
            with the class throughout the semester.</li>
          <li>The partner group is <b>willing to comply with research
              ethics standards</b>, including consent and debriefing,
            where required by Cornell University.<br>
          </li>
          <li>The partner group <b>commits</b> to publishing the
            results and crediting students for their contributions,
            whatever the results tare.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Not all projects conclude within the semester. Some teams
          only get as far as designing the study, at which point it's up
          to the organization to run the study or not. In other cases,
          the study is started before the semester ends but completed
          sometime in the summer. In those cases, students have the
          option to come back to support analysis if they're interested,
          though it's not required.<br>
        </p>
        <p>What do you get out of collaboration?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Students can offer guidance on theories of change,
            informed by scientific literature</li>
          <li>Students can define the specific details of the study
            design, codified into an experiment plan<br>
          </li>
          <li>Students can conduct sample size calculations</li>
          <li>Students can guide decisions about what statistical
            tests/models to use</li>
          <li>Students write essays that analyze questions about ethics
            and social impact related to the project<br>
          </li>
          <li>When the study is completed in time, students can support
            analysis<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>What do students get out of the collaboration?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Applying what their learning to real-wold questions</li>
          <li>Gaining experience working with a collaborator/client</li>
          <li>Thinking through a real-world example when <br>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>2014 was the year that the digital media company Upworthy
          “broke the internet” in the words of cofounder Peter Koechley.
          By publishing positive, progressive news stories and
          optimizing them with A/B testing, Upworthy came to dominate
          online attention.</p>
        <p>In 2019, Good Inc. and Upworthy <a

          students. Student teams worked with this dataset to seek
          insights through meta-analyzing large numbers of experiments

        <p>Many users join gender-related discussions online to discuss
          current events and their personal experiences. However, people
          sometimes feel unwelcome those communities for two reasons.
          First of all, they may be interested in participating in
          constructive discussions, but their opinions differ from the a
          community's vocal majority. Accordingly, they feel
          uncomfortable voicing these opinions due to fear of an
          overwhelmingly negative reaction. Furthermore, as we
          discovered in a survey, some participants in online gender
          conversations oppose feminism and wish to make the experience
          uncomfortable for commenters.</p>
        <p>In this ongoing study, two undergraduate students worked with
          moderators of an online community to test the effects on
          newcomer participation of interventions that provide
          first-time participants with more accurate information about
          the values of the community and its organizers.<br>

        <p>In information security, warning messages are used to inform

          disinformation websites.</p>
        <p>Because the possible message designs too numerous to be

            Hounsel</a> developed software to generate advertisements

        <p>In this study, we asked how common these mistakes are and
          what kinds of ads are mistakenly prohibited by Facebook and
          Google. Over 23 days, 7 U.S. citizens living inside and
          outside the United States attempted to publish 477
          non-election advertisements that varied in the type of ad, its
          potentially-mistaken political leaning, and its geographic
          targeting to a federal or state election voter population.
          Google did not prohibit any of the ads posted. Facebook
          prohibited 4.2% of the submitted ads.</p>
