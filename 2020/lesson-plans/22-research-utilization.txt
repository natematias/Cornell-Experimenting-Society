How do people who love baking survive dorm life? Microwave mug-cakes are a classic staple for people without ovens. Here's a mug-cake slice with brule-ed marshmallow I made earlier today.

But what if I'm too busy to actually use a microwave? I suppose I should just pour the ingredients into the mug:
- almond flour, sugar
- milk
- oil
- chocolate
- and one egg

And since it's topped with marshmallow, I could always spoon some of this on top. Finally, to save time, if I bruleé the marshmallows, I don't even have to bother with the microwave. Voila!

We started the semester by discussing experiments as an alternative to the Highest Paid Person's Opinion. We have also discussed many ways that research can go wrong without peer review. In this week's class, we'll discuss the uses *and* misuses of research.

Carol Weiss's article on the Many Meanings of Research Utilization gives us a vocabulary for thinking about the good, bad, and complicated uses of research top:
- develop knowledge
- solve problems
- inform decision-making
- score political points
- deflect criticism
- and what Weiss calls "enlightenment"

In Anne Scheel's blog post about fast-moving pandemic research, we'll also discuss debates among scientists about the risk of publishing partially-baked ideas where they can get used before they're ready.

After all, when time is short, it's important to get knowledge out there when it can make the most difference– just like my mugcake!

See you in class!
