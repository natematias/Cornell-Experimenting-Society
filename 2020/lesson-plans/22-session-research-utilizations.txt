Hi everyon


My goals for today's class are to:
- review and discuss Weiss's kinds of research utilization
- discuss the question of fast and slow research
- review any questions you may have about the final essay proposal

To start out, can each of you share one kind of research utilization listed by Weiss, perhaps with an example you can think of?

---------

@here what did you think of the "enlightenment" model? That can be the hardest to understand or see, but it's what Weiss at least claims is the strongest influence of the social sciences in policy.

In case it helps, here are some examples of "enlightenment" :

    sometimes a social scientist puts an idea on the table that no one was thinking about before. Examples are "social network," "emotional labor," "behavioral science," and "stereotype." It's not really a "finding" but it's an idea that shapes how people see things. Both quantitative and qualitative researchers often aspire to this
    the idea of A/B testing is itself a kind of academic idea- something about the process of knowledge rather than a specific finding.

I hope this article is helpful to you as you do research, and you read about research. Many people, think about research as static knowledge rather than something usable with potential energy that does things in the world (or not). Weiss, who passed away a few years ago, spent most of her career at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, who named their newsletter "Usable Knowledge" in honor of her life work.

Next up: the blog post on pandemic research. At this stage in the pandemic, how many @here have run into some kind of analysis or claim or evidence that felt not fully baked? If you have, can you tell us about it and what seemed incomplete or rushed?

@here For Wednesday's session, I'm going to schedule Zoom catch-ups with teams. Normally, we would have have done it all together, so you could learn from other classes, but that won't be possible, alas.

@here thanks again for a great discussion today. As we say farewell, share one thing you've learned about yourself, or one new thing you've picked up since the pandemic.
