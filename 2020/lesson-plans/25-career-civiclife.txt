How can this jumble of wood and string become a stable structure? (complete tensegrity)

In a tensegrity, tension across multiple parts gives cohesion to a structure that seems improbable.

Experiments have become one of society's essential threads in the last hundred years, producing evidence that saves lives, makes millions of dollars, and guides our understanding of justice. They're so valuable that experiments are now everywhere, creating new questions about manipulation, privacy, and accountability.

Many past students in this class go on to use experiments in their work. Some routinely test ideas in finance. One tests campaign ideas for a presidential candidate. Another is designing experimentation software for a major tech company. Others need to interpret A/B tests in their roles as managers. Several do social science research. Their knowledge of experiments helped them get their job and steer their organizations toward evidence-based practices. Each of them is putting the pieces together in their own unique way.


Throughout your life, your knowledge of experiments is going to mean so much more than a job to you, your families, and your communities. In The Company We Keep, University of Chicago Wayne Booth wrote about the duty and satisfactions of contributing our knowledge to the people in our life, our civic world, and even sending notes of encouragement to writers and researchers. That's my hope for you. 

I have loved getting to know you in this, my first class at Cornell As you go through life, keep in touch and let me know how these pieces come together for you.
