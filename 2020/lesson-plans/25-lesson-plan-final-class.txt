Icebreaker:
  - What is the first thing you plan to do after you file finals?

My goals for today's session:
- discuss career directions and the role of experimentation in our broader lives
- discuss any questions about the final and the final personal essay
- celebrate each other and what we have achieved

First, I hope you have had a chance to watch the short video I posted to Canvas with slides about next steps in field experimentation- if you missed it, the slides are here: https://github.com/natematias/design-governance-experiments/blob/master/lectures/Lecture%2022%20-%20Career%20Steps%20in%20Experimentation.pdf

How do you see the class overlapping with your career interests? If you're a senior and have lined up a job, might you tell us about it? If you're still looking, consider sharing more about the kind of thing you're looking for. For juniors and earlier, how do you see the topics in this class overlapping with potential career directions.

In the slide deck, I link to books, professional societies (and even a comedy club) for continuing your interest! I be able to answer to point you to further links and resources?

Let's talk @here about the final. Do you have any questions about your personal essay and team final? Personal essay drafts are due Tuesday evening, and I'll turn feedback around on Wednesday, since I know everything's due Monday.

@here as we wrap up class, I have two final things I would like to do together.
First, we're going to take a moment to share appreciation for each other. In a discussion & group class, each student makes a very real and meaningful contribution to the learning experience, and this is our time to acknowledge that. Since the class is split up in two sessions, we're going to do this in two parts:

1. share appreciation for students in the room now. I'll start a thread for each person, and I encourage you to say one thing you appreciate about them.
2. if you like, you can also tag one person who's not in the room today with a message of appreciation

Finally, I would normally bring coffee and snacks on a day like this, but since that's not possible, I came up with a next best thing. I purchased a copy of Wes Tank rapping FOX IN SOX to Dr Dre to share with you so we can all remember one of the uplifting moments of the pandemic. Here's the download.

You have permission to save it and use it on your own devices. If you like it and want to share it outside the class, I encourage you to think twice about just sharing it and encouraging friends to sign up to Wes's patreon. It's not an easy time for YouTubers!
