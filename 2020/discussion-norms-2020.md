# COMM 4940 Discussion Norms
January 2020

In COMM 4940, we are discussing ideas as much as working with data. To create the most interesting and meaningful discussion environment, the students of the class created a set of guidelines for discussion. Students listed peeves for discussion classes alongside best practices.

### Peeves
* Lack of a respectful environment
* Taking arguments personally
* One person dominates
* Environments that make people afraid to disagree
* Prioritizing being right over exploring / understanding
* Rabbit trails üêá
* Judging someone for not having something to say
* Lack of structure
* Inactive moderator that lets discussions go off the rails
* Inattention from classmates
* Awkward silences, with no one willing to go first

### Best Practices
* Come prepared (the Slack conversation can help here)
* Respect toward others
* Active listening to others
* Ask questions, not just share opinions
* Respond and reference other people's points
* Disagree with people's *arguments* rather than the person
* The instructor should summarize the discussion at the end
* Give people time to think
* There is a place and time to be emotional. That's sometimes class. Choose wisely and respect others' choices
* Take good notes (Here's [the Cornell system for class notes](http://lsc.cornell.edu/study-skills/cornell-note-taking-system/))
