- Correlation vs causation

- How many tests before we can make strong claims?
- What are we testing when we operationalize theories? (mind of the experimenter)

- Do we need a control group? (comparing to standard treatment or a placebo)
- Does a larger sample make the experiment more representative? No.
- Is it always best to increase the sample size?
- Using OLS versus a series of t-tests
- Percentage point versus percent difference

- Reporting in terms of absolute numbers: In 2013, the company has almost 90 million monthly active users. If we show everyone this headline, it would receive roughly 9.5 million clicks, give or take 2.5 million
- Reporting in terms of confidence interval: "If the organization was to show headline 1 to 1000 people, then a range of about 8 to 13 people would click on the article"
- "Headlines 1 and 3 were significantly more likely to be clicked on by readers than headlines 2 and 4..."
