# Proposing Interventions and Theories of Change
The Great Backyard Bird Count is often a first step for people who continue on to contribute to citizen science through the Lab of Ornithology. In this assignment **in pairs**, you will work with your partner to imagine theories of change, propose messaging, and explain why you think the intervention will cause more people to sign up than might ordinarily.

* Look at the [example of last year's follow-up email](GBBC-example-email-2019.png)
* Read this article on the reasons people participate in citizen science:
  * West, S. E., & Pateman, R. M. (2016). [Recruiting and retaining participants in citizen science: What can be learned from the volunteering literature?](https://theoryandpractice.citizenscienceassociation.org/articles/10.5334/cstp.8/). Citizen Science: Theory and Practice. (pay particular attention to the section on sustained participation)
* Create a list of possible ⬆️ *promoting pressures* and ⬇️ *inhibiting pressures* for someone to open the email, click a link, and sign up for a further project.
  * Changing the headline / email subject
  * Changing the text and layout of the Call to Action
* Create, in Word, Google Docs, or a PDF, the headline/subject and call to action that you think will be more influential
* Write no more than 3 paragraphs that list the pressures you choose to influence and how you think your changes will influence them (try to keep to one page)
* Provide a rating on a scale of 1 to 10 for how confident you are that the messaging/email will be more effective than the current one
* Submit your list, your proposed email, and your short essay together on Canvas
